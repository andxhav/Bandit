Pitch:
This is a webapp designed to allow bands in a local 'scene' to collaborate, find new band members,
post gigs, share their bandcamp music, and list their musicians.
Musicians can create a profile, show off their learned instruments, and mark themselves as available for projects.
Non Musician Users to the site should see bands in their local scene, upcoming gigs, and wanted adds.
Musicians should be able to see the same but also be able to join Bands, create Bands, and curate their profile.
