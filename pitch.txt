Pitch:
This is a webapp designed to allow bands in a local 'scene' to collaborate, find new band members,
post gigs, share their bandcamp music, and list their musicians.
Musicians can create a profile, show off their learned instruments, and mark themselves as available for projects.
Non Musician Users to the site should see bands in their local scene, upcoming gigs, and wanted adds.
Musicians should be able to see the same but also be able to join Bands, create Bands, and curate their profile.

Good Morning everyone, My name is Andrew Haveles.

Growing up, I was always very drawn to problem solving and building things from the ground up.

I then went on to pursue my BS in Mechanical engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute to hone in my engineer's problem solving mindset,
furthering my love for applied problem solving through design and analysis.

As I entered the engineering workforce, I found myself enjoying many aspecs of the field, but always felt i was craving more direct and engaging problem solving.

During my time at an IoT startup, i was exposed to many of the facets of web development and saw how engaging the work was and how it was such a direct/constant use of my engineer's skills set.

So, through the encouragement of my friends, family, and colleagues, I decided this was the next step in my career, and decided to join Launch Academy to accelerate this next step.

Now, I am not just a nerd who loves engineering, but I am also a nerd who loves to spend their time making and listening to music.

The problem is, I've always found it hard to jump into a city's local music scene and find people to play and collaborate with.

That is why I have decided to take my new skills from Launch A to develop a webapp I am calling Bandit.

Bandit is a platform that will allow users to facilitate collaboration and creation within their local music scene on an open and free platform.

Users will be able to make a musician's profile, integrate their BandCamp recordings, and either start a band, look for new members, or mark yourself as available to join projects.

Musicians and nonMusicians alike will be able to browse the bands in their scene and find new local music to support or collab with.

Bands will be able to promote their shows, share new music, or update their fanbase on their profile's blog posts.

Bands in the DIY music scene will be able to more easily share, gather, and plan via this platform, creating whole new path for community organization possibilities.

At the end of the day, I am creating this to facilitate collaboration in independent music communities and make these local bands easier to find, support, and follow.

Local music is a major cultural aspect of a community, and  through Bandit, accessiblity for everyone is my goal.


Thank you for your time.



Bullet Points:
intro::::
- growing up love of problem solving and building/creating
- lead me to pursue my undergrad degree in ME from WPI
- there i...fully realized and honed my engineer's skillset
- I then entered the workforce - enjoyed many aspecs, but still had craving for consistent PS and direct hands in building
- during my time at an IoT startup - exposed to many facets of webdev and was facinated - decided thats what i wanted
- thru encouragement from many people - decided to accelerate my next career step with Launch Academy

transition::::
- NOW not just a nerd who loves problem solving - also a huge music nerd
- always had trouble getting into local music - thats why Bandit
  - finding bands to follow, other musicians, and local gigs

app::::
- Users can: view bands in their scene, view musicians, view upcoming gigs
- if users would like to create their own musician profile - they can log in and generate their Profile
- there they can describe themselves, start a band, or mark themselves as open for projects
- if they have a band, they can add or remove members, embed their bandcamp, etc
- Bands can also create gig's, promote them, and show users map with google maps Api
- at the end of the day the goal is to make local music easier to explore and far more accessible
